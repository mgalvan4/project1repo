    <p>There really isn't a solid theme for the media I collect, it is just a collection of media I have been storing on my desktop, mostly mp4's that tickle my brain</p>
    <p>This section will contain my favorite videos, images, and , if I can find them, audio clips. I will title each of them, provide alt text, and attempt to make witty descriptions</p>
    <section>
      <h1>The Penta Palace</h1>
      <p>This area is of clips related to the popular twitch streamer Penta who is essentially a stand up comedian. His ensemble will also be included, et. al.</p>
